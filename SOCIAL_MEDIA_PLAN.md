- Configure PostgreSQL database connection
- Set up Hibernate JPA configuration
- Configure WebSocket support
- Set up basic security configuration

### 1.2 Frontend Setup  
- Initialize React application
- Install Material UI components
- Set up routing with React Router
- Configure WebSocket client
- Set up state management (Redux/Context)

### 1.3 Database Design
- Users table (id, username, email, password, profile_info, created_at)
- Posts table (id, user_id, content, image_url, created_at, updated_at)
- Comments table (id, post_id, user_id, content, created_at)
- Likes table (id, post_id, user_id, created_at)
- Friendships table (id, user_id, friend_id, status, created_at)
- Messages table (id, sender_id, receiver_id, content, created_at, read_status)
- Notifications table (id, user_id, type, content, read_status, created_at)

## AI Agent Implementation Notes:
1. Follow this plan sequentially
2. Create comprehensive tests for each component
3. Use consistent naming conventions
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Document API endpoints clearly
6. Use TypeScript for better type safety
7. Follow REST API best practices
8. Implement proper validation on both frontend and backend
9. Use environment variables for configuration
10. Create reusable components and services
